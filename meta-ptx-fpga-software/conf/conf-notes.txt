Image targets are:

	core-image-minimal

The built SD card image contains the OpenSBI, Linux-Kernel and rootfs. The
FPGA bitstream is built as a dependency, but not included in the SD card
image, since it is loaded from the SPI flash.

To build only the FPGA bitstream bitbake:

	ptxsoc-vexriscv

The FGPA bitstream must explicitly copied to the flash. The recommended method
is to use the openFPGALoader:

	openFPGAloader -b ecpix5 -f build/tmp/deploy/images/ecpix5-vexriscv/ptxsoc.bit
